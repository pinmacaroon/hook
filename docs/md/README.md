## Features

This mod offers:

- One-way chat message proxying or two-way if desired;
- Simple configuration;
- Straightforward features;
- Server-side, Discord Bot-less architecture.

### Configurable and toggleable messages

Toggle server status messages such as: server staring, server started, server
stopping, server stopped.

Toggle whether users can make their messages unproxyable (ignored by the mod) by
applying two forward slashes (`//`) at the end of their chat messages.

### Easy setup

Setting this mod up is just a matter of following the steps on the [documentation page](https://pinmacaroon.github.io/hook/docs.html#setup)

## "HELP, IT AINT WORKIN', WHAT AM I SUPPOSD' TO DO?"

Calm down, we'll go step by step.

Check the config file.

- Did I paste the URL to the right place?
- Is it the right URL?
- Did I delete an `=`?
- Did I put an extra space somewhere?
- Did I accidentally turn the mod off?

Check the console of the server.

- Did my server say something about the webhook not being a valid API endpoint?
- Did my server say something about the webhook not being found or not having
  connection to Discord?

Still doesn't work? Well, I (pin, the one who made this mod) am also a "human",
so I make mistakes too. If you think I made one, report it to me! See the
sidebar for links!
